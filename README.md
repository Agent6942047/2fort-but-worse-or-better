papaquill called this map shit but people seem to love it when i host it
map for tf2 xbox use test_startscript to launch idk u installed it u should already have your menu set up i aint the expert
its in 3 part cuz im a bad modder like my name says i couldnt figure out why certain props i wanted to spawn wouldnt spawn but whatever i will be updating this atleast 2 more times i have changes in mind i will make em once i stop being a lazy fuck also this map can be combined with practicaly any 2fort gamemode like koth saxtonhale and the one with teleporters sorta the hl2 horse is covering one of the tele but u can still go trough it its basically just cosmetic u can remove it from the code u can find the hourse prop covering the teleporter by using the command in the beta while playtesting "picker" and
"ent_text"
