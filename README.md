papaquill called this map shit but people seem to love it when i host it
map for tf2 xbox use test_startscript to launch idk u installed it u should already have your menu set up i aint the expert
its in 3 part cuz im a bad modder like my name says i couldnt figure out why certain props i wanted to spawn wouldnt spawn but whatever i will be updating this atleast 2 more times i have changes in mind i will make em once i stop being a lazy fuck also this map can be combined with practicaly any 2fort gamemode like koth saxtonhale and Ufort sorta on of the hl2 horses covers one of the teleporters but u can still go trough it, its basically just cosmetic u can remove it from the code u can find the hourse prop covering the teleporter by using the command in the beta while playtesting "picker" and
"ent_text" or just delete "makehorse2;test_wait .02;
ent_setname horse2;test_wait .02;
ent_fire horse2 addoutput "origin -4380 260 50";ent_fire horse2 addoutput "angles 0 0";" i think idk theres only 2 horses on that map it cant be that hard for u to remove good luck flying traveling modder
